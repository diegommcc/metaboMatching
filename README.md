# metaboMatching

An R package for identification of metabolites based on m/z. 

This is a bunch of useful functions that can be used to perform these tasks. However, I wouldn't say this is an R package:

* I don't use specific classes to store data
* I don't have many things into account when parameters are provided

Eventually, I'll formalize all these things. Morevoer, in order to make it generalized, I will integrate it with chemoinformatics packages that allows to do: 

* Calculations with adduct masses (as in <https://saezlab.github.io/lipyd/>)
* Plot structures

Moreover, would be grat to integrate it with XCMS, but this is out of the scope of this implementation. 

## Stuff to be implemented

* Programmatic access to Lipid Maps.
